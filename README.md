# Expense Management WebApp

The Expense Management Web App was created in 2004 to conduct a experiement. Students were randomly asked to use the web-app and complete tasks. At the end of the tasks, students were asked to rate the application across several dimensions.
Three versions of the app were presented, each version had the same functionality however there was an artificial latency introduced.
