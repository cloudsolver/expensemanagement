<u>Purpose of Research</u>
<p>
 This study investigates the relationship between Web-page response time and task completion speed and the efficiency dimension of electronic service quality.  This study will serve to collectively advance the field of Web efficiency, electronic service quality & usability.
</p>
<u>Specific Procedures to be Used</u>
<p>
Participants will be asked to visit a custom Web-site. They will be provided data to enter into the Web-site. Three sets of data will be provided to each participants. After entering each data set, the participants will fill out an 8-question survey. Registration with the Web-site is anonymous, no information is collected that can individually identify a participant. After all data is entered and surveys completed, participants will sign-out of the Web-site. This completes their participation.
</p>
<u>Duration of Participation</u>
